This will be my first project, a little project. So, it will probably be not good for a long time. Because I am learning. But I will do me best. When it is good enough, I will delete these words :)

This is a Timer. Very simple app which will first work on webos, for my palm pre plus and HP Touchpad, Enyo 1.0 required. When Enyo 2 is developed, this app will be moved on enyo2, thus will work on most web browser and OS.

As I planned, this app is a part of a big project. The project will be a personal time manager, which will be really useful for me. I hope it will be useful for others.

Of cause, I am not sure if I can finish the whole project. However, I will try my best.

Thank you.
